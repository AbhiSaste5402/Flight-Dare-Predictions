# Flight-Fare-Predictions
Overview:
This Flight Fare Prediction WebApp is a web-based application that leverages machine learning to predict flight fares based on various features. It is built using a multi-step process that involves data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.

Data Collection:
The first step in building the machine learning model for the Flight Fare Prediction WebApp is data collection. Historical flight data, including features such as departure and arrival locations, departure and arrival times, airline information, and other relevant details, is collected from reliable sources. This data is used as the training dataset to train the machine learning model.

Data Preprocessing:
Once the data is collected, it undergoes a data preprocessing step to clean and prepare it for further analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting categorical variables into numerical representations, and normalizing or scaling numerical features. Data preprocessing is a crucial step as it ensures that the data used for model training is accurate and reliable.

Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming the most relevant features from the collected data to improve the model's performance. In this Flight Fare Prediction WebApp, various features such as departure and arrival times, airline information, and other relevant details are used to create new features or modify existing ones. For example, the Journey Dates, Arrival and Depature Time were chnaged to single column providing the proper format that the machine can understand, the airline information, Total stops of the plane, Source, Destination were One-Hot encoded into numerical representations for input into the model.

Model Training:
After data preprocessing and feature engineering, the next step is to train the machine learning model. The selected features and their corresponding target variable (i.e., the flight fare) were used to train the model using a suitable algorithm such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting. This was done using the GridSearch CV method to know the best fit model from all. The training dataset was split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation:
Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using the validation dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared are commonly used to measure the accuracy and performance of the model.

WebApp Development:
The machine learning model was integrated into a web-based application using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A user-friendly interface was designed to allow users to input the relevant flight details, such as departure and arrival locations, departure and arrival times, and airline information. The input data is then passed to the trained machine learning model for prediction. The predicted flight fare is displayed to the user as the output, providing an estimate of the expected flight fare for the given details.

Conclusion:
The Flight Fare Prediction WebApp is built using a multi-step process that involves data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation. The machine learning model was trained using historical flight data and evaluated for accuracy and performance. Once the model is deemed reliable, it is integrated into a web-based application for user-friendly flight fare predictions.
